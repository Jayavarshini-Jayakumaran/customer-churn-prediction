    "- The dataset contains **8,453 customer records**.\n",
    "- The target variable **CHURN is highly imbalanced**, with approximately **93% non-churn** and **7% churn** customers.\n",
    "- This imbalance indicates the need for **class-balancing strategies** (e.g., class weights or resampling) during model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Customer Segmentation\n",
    "- A large proportion of customers belong to the **Bronze value segment** and **SOHO business category**.\n",
    "- These dominant segments are likely to have a **strong influence on overall churn behavior** and business decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Revenue Patterns\n",
    "- **Mobile services** contribute the majority of revenue, with a median **AvgMobileRevenue around 110–115**.\n",
    "- **Fixed-line revenue** is zero for most customers, indicating a **mobile-centric customer base**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Outliers and Irregularities\n",
    "- Several numerical features, such as **Active_subscribers**, **Not_Active_subscribers**, and **ARPU**, show extreme maximum values compared to their means.\n",
    "- This suggests the presence of **outliers and right-skewed distributions**, which may require transformation or robust modeling techniques."

    "\n",
    "The exploratory data analysis (EDA) provided a comprehensive understanding of customer behavior, revenue patterns, and churn dynamics within the dataset. The key findings are summarized below:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Quality and Completeness\n",
    "- Most business-critical variables were complete and reliable, indicating strong overall data quality.\n",
    "- A small number of features contained extremely high missing values and were identified as low-informative for churn prediction.\n",
    "- These features were flagged for removal to reduce noise and improve model generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Customer Engagement Patterns\n",
    "- The majority of customers maintain a relatively low to moderate number of active subscriptions.\n",
    "- A smaller subset of customers shows significantly higher engagement, indicating heterogeneous usage behavior.\n",
    "- Engagement-based features emerged as strong indicators of customer value and churn risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Revenue Distribution Insights\n",
    "- Revenue-related variables (`TotalRevenue`, `AvgMobileRevenue`, `ARPU`) are heavily right-skewed.\n",
    "- Most customers generate moderate revenue, while a small group contributes disproportionately high revenue.\n",
    "- These high-value customers represent strategic business assets despite their low frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Churn Characteristics\n",
    "- The target variable (**CHURN**) is highly imbalanced, with churners forming a small minority.\n",
    "- This highlights the importance of specialized handling techniques such as class-weighted models or oversampling.\n",
    "- Simply optimizing for accuracy would be misleading in this context.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Categorical Feature Behavior\n",
    "- Several categorical features contained rare or inconsistent categories.\n",
    "- Cleaning and consolidation were necessary to prevent sparse encodings and unstable model behavior.\n",
    "- Segment-based variables showed potential to capture meaningful churn-related patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Feature Relationships\n",
    "- Strong correlations were observed between:\n",
    "  - Active subscriptions and total revenue\n",
    "  - Mobile revenue and overall customer value\n",
    "- Geographic identifiers showed negligible correlation with revenue and churn.\n",
    "- This helped prioritize behavior-driven features over location-based attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Outliers and Business Interpretation\n",
    "- Outliers in revenue and ARPU represent genuine high-value customers rather than data errors.\n",
    "- These customers warrant special attention, as their churn would have a disproportionate financial impact.\n",
    "- Rather than removing outliers, they were retained for their business significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Modeling Implications\n",
    "- EDA findings directly informed feature engineering decisions, including:\n",
    "  - Ratio-based engagement features\n",
    "  - Revenue normalization\n",
    "  - Categorical consolidation\n",
    "- The analysis ensured alignment between business understanding and machine learning readiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Takeaway\n",
    "This EDA established a strong foundation for predictive modeling by transforming raw data into meaningful business insights.  \n",
    "The findings guided feature selection, preprocessing strategies, and modeling decisions, ensuring that the churn prediction model will be both **accurate** and **business-relevant**."
